    'content' => '<p>It’s that time of year again: graduation, when students transition away from the classroom to what will hopefully be a long and successful career in their chosen industry. I recently said goodbye to some of my own website design and development students. Instead of teaching lessons in design principles or responsive websites, I spent our final evening together answering their questions. One of those questions was, “<strong>What is the best career advice you’ve ever received?</strong>”</p>

<p>At the time, I didn’t have an answer. I could think of many instances when someone helped me solve a particularly complex design challenge or a complex CSS issue or helped me navigate a delicate client situation, but I wouldn’t consider those “best career advice” moments. After thinking about it for a week or so, I came up with four pieces of advice that I received early in my career and that were invaluable to me as I was getting started in this industry but that are just as relevant and useful to me today.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/06/13/career-advice-for-graduating-web-design-students/">Career Advice For Graduating Web Design Students</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com">Smashing Magazine</a>.</p>

With different <a href="http://philipwalton.com/articles/what-no-one-told-you-about-z-index/">stacking orders and contexts</a>, keeping track of them as their numbers increase can be hard &#8212; and once they start to spread across CSS files, forget about it! Because z-index can make or break a UI element’s visibility and usability, keeping your website’s UI in working order can be a delicate balance.</p>

<p>Because <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/15/the-z-index-css-property-a-comprehensive-look/">z-index is contextual</a>, once you start using it, requiring it for other elements as well is easy. Finding <code>z-index: 99999</code> rules scattered throughout a website is not uncommon, but <strong>the infamous</strong> <code>99999</code> <strong>was born of frustration</strong>. It’s an easy way to get an element just to be on top of everything else. But it’s not entirely scalable: What if you need to add something on top of that?</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/06/12/sassy-z-index-management-for-complex-layouts/">Sassy Z-Index Management For Complex Layouts</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com">Smashing Magazine</a>.</p>

<p>Over the past four years, I’ve completed three typefaces inspired by handwriting. I started with the digitization of Albert Einstein’s handwriting and continued with <a href="http://haraldgeisler.com/conspired-lovers/">Conspired Lovers</a>, a font based on my own love-letter writing. In 2013, I ran a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/201030759/sigmund-freud-typeface-a-letter-to-your-shrink">Kickstarter campaign</a> to fund the creation of a font based on Sigmund Freud’s handwriting.
